Hello,

This is my project where I am learning Selenium test automation in Java. The approach I take here is not necessarily the most pragmatic one; the focus is on solving problems in different ways and experimentation. It shows what I know and probably a lot of what I am still lacking.

The demo website being tested here can be modified by anyone. It hasn't happened to me yet, but there may be changes that result in failed tests.

There is another project I am actively working on and plan to upload to my GitHub. It is a Java app that generates XML files for one of the APIs at my workplace. I should upload it after masking all the business data it uses.
