Hello

This is my project where I am learning Selenium test automation in Java. The approach I take here is not necessarily the most pragmatic one; the focus is on solving problems in different ways and experimentation. It shows what I know and probably a lot of what I am still lacking.

The demo website being tested here can be modified by anyone. It hasn't happened to me yet, but there may be changes that result in failed tests.
